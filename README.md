# CPA-MoRe: A compound-protein binding affinity prediction model based on multi-view molecule representations fusion

CPA-MoRe is a deep-learning model to predict compound-protein binding affinity, which takes the molecular graphs of compounds,the Chemical Checker signatures of compoundsm and the one-dimensional sequences of proteins as input.
